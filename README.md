<b>\*</b>Substituting Hdyproxypropl Cellulose for Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
### Original Text 

Chemicals and materials. HPC (average MW: ~80,000, 370,000 and 1000,000),
sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ACS reagent), hydrochloric acid (HCl, ACS reagent)
and lithium chloride (LiCl, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Low-grade
KGM was purchased from Modernist Pantry® on Amazon. All chemicals were used
without further purification.

Fabrication procedures. In a typical fabrication, LiCl powder (0.32–0.82 g) is
added into 10 mL HPC solution (0–2.0 wt%) forming solution A. The pH of
solution A can be tuned by NaOH or HCl solution. 0.44 g KGM powder is added
into solution A and quickly cast into the petri dish after vortex. The gelation takes
place within 2 min, and sit in room temperature for 15 min. Then, the film is
placed in the fridge (−4 °C) for 3 h followed by 15 min freeze in liquid nitrogen.
Last, the gel film is ready to use after 12 h freeze-drying. The final LiCl concentration in SHPFs is characterized by TGA.

Results.  Preparation and characterization of SHPFs. SHPFs are synthesized via a facile, user-friendly casting method (Fig. 2a, also see
Methods for more details). In a typical synthesis, a gel precursor
containing KGM, HPC, and LiCl is well mixed and then poured
into a mold, where the gelation takes place within 2 min without
any chemical crosslinkers or initiators. This gelation of KGM/
HPC gels is achieved by self-agglomeration through hydrogen
bonding23,24. After freeze-drying, the SHPF can be peeled off
from the mold for direct use. SHPFs can be easily scaled up
(Fig. 2b) with tuneable sizes and shapes (Fig. 2c). From the
scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, a rough surface with
micro-sized pores ranging from 20–50 µm can be observed
(Fig. 2d). This microporous structure is primarily facilitated by
the hydrophilic KGM25, which enlarges the interfacial area of the
SHPF and air. In addition, HPC also helps form sub-millimeter
pores that are beneficial for rapid water vapor transport (Supplementary Fig. 2). To optimize the moisture sorption kinetics
(Supplementary Figs. 3–5), the SHPF with a thickness of ~100 µm
is used for AWH experiments in this work (Fig. 2e).
The chemical composition of SHPFs is analyzed by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2f). In the spectrum of
KGM (black curve), the absorption bands at 3390 and 2876 cm−1
are assigned to the stretching of –OH groups and C–H of methyl,
while the characteristic peaks of mannose appear at 875 and 804 cm −1 26,27. The peaks of HPC (blue curve) at 1060 and 2971 cm−1 are
assigned to the –CH2–O–CH2 stretching and the –CH stretching of
the methyl group, respectively28. The spectrum of SHPF (red curve)
contains the combination of all characteristic peaks of KGM and
HPC, confirming their co-existence in the SHPF network.
